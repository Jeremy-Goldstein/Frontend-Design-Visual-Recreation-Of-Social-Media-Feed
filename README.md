# Frontend-Design-Visual-Recreation-Of-Social-Media-Feed

This [project](https://jeremy-goldstein.github.io/Frontend-Design-Visual-Recreation-Of-Social-Media-Feed/) a demonstration of HTML, CSS, and Boostrap expertise by recreating the front-end of a social media feed. This case-study shows the Instagram feed as it appears for logged in users in 2018, including: posts, comments, suggested pages, and sidebar. Additionally, this page demonstrates responsive behavior, meaning that the layout and content dynamically adjusts based on users' screen size and magnification.
